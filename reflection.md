- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is talking about a virtual bird who can do so many thing. It is in fact a game. The bird name itself, has the possibility to grow , to shrink, to grab an item to construct his nest, to use it, to drop it , to initialize its weight, etc... The bird has the possibility to grab an item, examine it and use it to buils its nest. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added Weight() . basically, it ask the user to define the weight of the bird

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Many things worked for me because I had the choice of knowing how to implements the ideas I had. What did not work, is that some ideas I had were hard to implement then I had to find other ways to move and have the same results. The advice I will give is to be creative and try everything that passes in your mind
